I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/). I've been conducting my research in the [Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/) - a joint research lab with Georgia State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Emory University led
by Professor [Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). I finished my Masters in Computer Science from the [University of New Mexico](https://www.unm.edu/) in 2019. I was fortunate to intern at [NOKIA BELL LABS](https://www.bell-labs.com/).    

My research endeavors focus on developing computational models for knowledge extraction from extensive datasets. The primary goal is to learn meaningful patterns from big data e.g., Neuroimaging to understand the brain's functionalities and dynamics aids in the intervention of neuropsychiatric disorders. Iâ€™ve worked on developing novel pattern mining, summarization, and clustering algorithms for big (medical) data, primarily to handle subject heterogeneity through coherent subgrouping. Moreover, I designed deep learning (DL) architectures optimized for sparse, high-dimensional data. These architectures have been instrumental in various downstream applications, such as transformer-based biclustering, 2D bottleneck-attention-modules for multi-modal fusion, and graph convolutional networks (GCN) for dynamic modeling of the human brain connectome. Another intriguing aspect of my work involves leveraging neurocomputational strategies to enhance state-of-the-art AI paradigms outlined as 'AI for the Brian by the Brian'. Furthermore, my research extends to NLP, with a focus on decoding the brain's activations associated with cognitive processes and linguistics.
