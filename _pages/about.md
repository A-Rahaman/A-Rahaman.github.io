I've finished my Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering from [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/) and was advised by Professor [Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). I design computational (AI/ML/statistical) models to learn insights from extensive datasets ‑ imaging, text, medical informatics, and time series. My research interests include Multi-modal Foundation Models, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Health AI, and Biclustering. 

I've experience in AI deployment in real-world settings - a federated multi-modal framework for disease screening from neuroimages, genetics, and electronic health records; an LLM-log model to automate IT ticket routing from the ticket description and machine log at [NOKIA BELL LABS](https://www.bell-labs.com/) (internship).

[I’ve worked on AI challenges for learning voluminous, sparse, and high‑dimensional data. 
 I've also conducted substantial research in the granular factoring of big data dynamics - bi-clustering, tri-clustering, and summarization frameworks. I am fascinated by AI solutions with plausible clinical impacts and healthcare implications. Another intriguing aspect of my work involves leveraging neurocomputational strategies to enhance SOTA AI. To this end, my projects are instantiated to various downstream tasks, e.g., transformer-based biclustering, classification, GNN for brain network modeling, 2D bottleneck-attention-module for multi-modal fusion, and Generative modeling]: Love playing outdoor games (mostly soccer) in my free time and fancy cooking my favorite dishes! * My email address: aabdur.rahaman007@gmail.com
