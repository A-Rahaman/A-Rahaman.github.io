I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/). I've been conducting my research in the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science[(TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/) - a joint research lab with Georgia Tech, Emory, and Georgia State University led
by Professor [Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). I finished my Masters in Computer Science from the University of New Mexico in 2019. I got a chance to intern at [NOKIA BELL LABS](https://www.bell-labs.com/) in Fall 2021.    

My research endeavors focus on developing computational models to extract knowledge from extensive datasets. I am particularly interested in the granular factoring of big data dynamics. Iâ€™ve developed novel clustering, pattern mining, and summarization algorithms for cohesive subgrouping of data instances. Also, I design ML/DL architecture tailored to resolving the challenges in sparse, high-dimensional, and complex data e.g., human brain images. To this end, AI frameworks are instantiated to a variety of downstream tasks e.g., transformer-based biclustering, classification, GNN for modeling brain network, 2D bottleneck-attention-module for multi-modal fusion, Generative modeling, etc. Another intriguing aspect of my work involves leveraging neurocomputational strategies to enhance state-of-the-art AI. 


**I am looking for a full-time position starting in Fall 2024.**
