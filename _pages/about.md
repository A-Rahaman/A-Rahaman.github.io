I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/), under the guidance of [Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en), and joined [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as an Applied Scientist in March 2025. 

My doctoral research focused on developing computational frameworks to extract meaningful insights from complex, large-scale datasets spanning imaging, text, time series, and medical informatics. My work bridges multiple domains, including Computer Vision (with a focus on Neurovision), Multi-modal Foundation Models, High-dimensional Clustering, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Vision Language Models (VLM). Moreover, I've experience in AI deployment - a federated multi-modal framework for disease screening; an LLM-log model to automate IT ticket routing from the ticket description and machine log at [NOKIA BELL LABS](https://www.bell-labs.com/) (internship). 

I'm passionate about translating cutting-edge research into practical applications that can solve real-world problems at scale.

[I’ve worked on AI challenges for learning voluminous, sparse, and high‑dimensional data. 
 I've also conducted substantial research in the granular factoring of big data dynamics - bi-clustering, tri-clustering, and summarization frameworks. I am fascinated by AI solutions with plausible clinical impacts and healthcare implications. Another intriguing aspect of my work involves leveraging neurocomputational strategies to enhance SOTA AI. To this end, my projects are instantiated to various downstream tasks, e.g., transformer-based biclustering, classification, GNN for brain network modeling, 2D bottleneck-attention-module for multi-modal fusion, and Generative modeling]: Love playing outdoor games (mostly soccer) in my free time and fancy cooking my favorite dishes! * My email address: aabdur.rahaman007@gmail.com
