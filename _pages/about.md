I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/). I've been conducting my research in the [Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/) - a joint research lab with Georgia State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Emory University led
by Professor [Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). I finished my Masters in Computer Science from the [University of New Mexico](https://www.unm.edu/) in 2019. I was fortunate to intern at [NOKIA BELL LABS](https://www.bell-labs.com/).    

My research endeavors focus on developing computational models for knowledge extraction from extensive datasets. Iâ€™ve worked on developing novel pattern mining, summarization, and clustering algorithms for big (medical) data. Moreover, I designed multiple deep learning (DL) architectures such as transformer-based biclustering, 2D bottleneck-attention-modules for multi-modal fusion, and graph convolutional networks (GCN) for dynamic modeling of the human brain connectome. Another intriguing aspect of my work involves leveraging neurocomputational strategies to enhance state-of-the-art AI paradigms. Furthermore, my research extends to NLP, focusing on decoding the brain's activations associated with cognitive processes and linguistics.
