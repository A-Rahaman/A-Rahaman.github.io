I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at [Georgia Tech](https://cse.gatech.edu/) and advised by Professor [Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en). I design computational (AI/ML/statistical) models to extract knowledge from extensive datasets ‑ imaging, text, health Informatics, time series, networks, etc. I’ve worked on AI challenges for learning voluminous, sparse, and high‑dimensional data. I've instantiated AI frameworks for classification, forecasting, semantic segmentation, transformer-based graph learning, etc. I am also interested in the granular factoring of big data dynamics - bi-clustering, tri-clustering, pattern mining, and summarization - algorithms for cohesive subgrouping of data instances. I deployed a multi-modal RLHF-powered AI model for classifying mental disorders using brain images, genomics, and electronic health records. At NOKIA Bell Labs, I deployed an LLM-log model to automate the routing of IT tickets from machine logs and customer error reports. These roles provided hands-on experience in surveillance, retraining, fine-tuning, and debugging AI solutions in real-world settings. Overall, I aim to develop AI solutions with plausible clinical impacts and healthcare implications. 

I got an opportunity to intern at [NOKIA BELL LABS](https://www.bell-labs.com/) in the Fall of 2021.

[Another intriguing aspect of my work involves leveraging neurocomputational strategies to enhance SOTA AI. To this end, my projects are instantiated to various downstream tasks, e.g., transformer-based biclustering, classification, GNN for brain network modeling, 2D bottleneck-attention-module for multi-modal fusion, and Generative modeling]:
I've been conducting my research in the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science[(TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/) - a joint research lab with Georgia Tech, Emory, and Georgia State University led

**I am looking for a full-time position starting in Fall 2024.** Love playing outdoor games (mostly soccer) in my free time and fancy cooking my favorite dishes!
